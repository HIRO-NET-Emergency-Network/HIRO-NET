In this folder, we have collected the algorithms that are executed by HIRO-NET in the discovery phase.
Specifically, the script test_AlgorithmToGenerateNewPoIs.m contains the following algorithms:
  - Generation of Voronoi Regions;
  - Clustering of Points of Interest (PoIs);
  - Assignment of PoIs to each drone;
  - Optimal Trajectory Computation.
  
Instead, the script test_AlgorithmToGenerateNewPoIs.m contains the following algorithms:
  - Real-time tracking of already visited portions of the map
  - Generation of new potential PoIs
